# Portfolio

#### Week 1

### Goals

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods

2. Pair using the driver-navigator style

3. Follow an effective debugging process

4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP


### Plans to achieve:

1. Working through Boris Bikes and TDD workshop

2. Debugging workshop and debugging my own code

3. Work through OOP practicals and implement in my code

4. Pairing on Boris bikes and other challenges - getting feedback from pair


### Evidence

1.
- Boris Bikes [here](https://github.com/taran314/Boris_bikes)
- Airport weekend challenge [here](https://github.com/taran314/airport_challenge)
- Discussed coding problems with peers

2.
- Paired all this week on weekday challenges
- Got feedback on how pairing went and what we could do better

3.
- Attended debugging workshop and completed tasks
- Debugged code using print statements

4.
- Practiced encapsulation and SRP in practical [here](https://github.com/taran314/secret_diary)
- Considered how I could implement abstraction in my code

### Reflection

Week has gone well! Made good progress on Boris bikes and I'm happy with my submission for the weekend challenge.
Tried to structure my time better for next week and set more manageable goals.
