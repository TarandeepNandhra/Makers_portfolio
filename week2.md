# Week 2

### Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)

2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage

3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking

4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)

5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### Evidence

1.
- consolidated week 1's skills when setting up Oystercard challenge and testdriving classes.

2.
- Split up the Journey class from Oystercard class in Oystercard challenge and refactored tests.

3.
- Dependency injection practical
- Used doubles and dependency injection to test Oystercard behaviour in isolation.
- Mocking workshop, testing relationships between classes workshop practical

4.
- SOLID principles
- Delegation
- Forwarding and polymorphism
- Polymorphism, inheritance and composition
- Composition over inheritance

5. 
- Reviewed Stu's airport challenge code and gave detailed feedback.
- Gave feedback to pair partners when working on their code.
